# Terraform-Azure-Deployment-IaC-

This project demonstrates my approach to deploying cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform on Azure. My primary goal is to follow best practices for infrastructure provisioning, security, and maintainability

Currently, the project includes:
- A functional Terraform deployment for core infrastructure components.
- A Jenkinsfile to support the automation of deployment processes.
- An ongoing CI/CD pipeline to streamline and automate infrastructure provisioning

Planned improvements:
- Refactoring the Terraform code into reusable modules for better scalability and maintainability.
- Adding essential components like databases, load balancers, and scalable virtual machine fleets.
- Enhancing the CI/CD pipeline for full end-to-end automation and validation

This project reflects my roadmap toward becoming a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer. Iâ€™m open to any constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement
